## Introduction

Citizen science projects like iNaturalist are becoming more credible as sources of research-grade data. While evasive species can create biases in absolute counts of observations, studies concerning within-species relative abundance may sidestep these issues by assuming that such reporting biases are uniform in time. Here we consider the relative abundance of 47 species of birds in Northern California over the 2019 calendar year. The number of observations for a given species per week is obtained from iNaturalist, accessed from their API using the R package `spocc`. Seasonality curves are then constructed from iNaturalist observations using techniques from kernel density estimation. The resulting seasonal trends may then be viewed as a sample of random curves (more specifically, probability densities) and can be studied under the framework of Functional Data Analysis. We will use functional principal component analysis to model the relative abundance of these species and identify a low-dimensional latent geometry which can be used to group similar bird species by their patterns of seasonality.



## From Points to Curves

For the $i^{th}$ species during the $j^{th}$ week, we observe the number of observations reported on iNaturalist, $x_{ij},~i=1,...,47,~j=1,...,52$. Using a Gaussian kernel $K(u) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}u^2}$ we obtain estimates for the seasonality curves given by:

$$f_i(t) = \dfrac{1}{52h}\sum_{j=1}^{52}K(\dfrac{t-x_{ij}}{h}),$$

where the bandwidth $h$ is a tuning parameter which modulates smoothness of curves and is chosen here to be $6$ weeks. The estimated densities for the 47 birds are shown below.

# plot(fpca_obj)

meandf = data.frame(x = fpca_obj$workGrid, mean =  fpca_obj$mu)

The bold black curve denotes the pointwise mean seasonality, which is roughly constant with a slight skew toward the later weeks of the year. This suggests the sample contains birds with a variety of seasonalities, though perhaps fall and winter birds are slightly over-represented. Note the 5 "outlier" curves which stand out above the crowd. These curves represent species which demonstrate extreme seasonality for each season, with winter being split into "early winter" and "late winter". This is the first sign of an interesting geometric phenomenon present in this data: we expect one representative peak per season, but because the calendar year artificially splits the winter months, the corresponding winter peak is divided into two. The Ferruginous hawk's seasonality exemplifies this: it has a global maximum during the early weeks, but experiences another local maximum toward the end of the year. If we could recognize the underlying geometry on which these curves lie, a kernel density estimate would join these two peaks into one! We will investigate this geometry further using functional principal component analysis, which will also perform dimension reduction on the curves and facilitate comparisons in seasonality patterns across species.

## Functional Principal Component Analysis

While a curve-based representation of seasonality is intuitive and easy to read for an individual species, understanding and comparing the trends of several species at a time is more difficult, as evidenced by the crowded figure displayed above. This difficulty can be attributed to the high-dimensional nature of curves: an infinite number of individual data points make up a single curve observation. Variation in each of these dimensions can come together to form major trends of variation which have meaninful interpretations, or can be minor noise more analogous to random noise. To understand the difference and identify the main patterns of variation in the curves, functional principal component analysis (FPCA) can afford us a low dimensional representation of the curves based on the Karhunen-Lo\`eve decomposition for stochastic processes. We describe the technical machinery in the appendix and display the results of FPCA here.

The first step in FPCA is to estimate the covariance surface for the sample of curves. The undulating shape of the surface indicates that prevalence is typically negatively correlated across opposite seasons, as one might expect. To see this, fix a time point $t$ and take a cross-section of the surface in either direction. The maximum and the minimum are roughly 25 weeks or 6 months apart from each other for all cross-sections. The cyclic nature of the seasons is suggested by the positive covariance on the edges of the off-diagonal. Here the covariance rises from the negative trough back into positive values, which suggests that January counts are positively associated with December counts. An intuitive way of visualizing this observation is to consider tesselating the surface across the plane: the edges of the surface align across tesselated copies! 



```{r, echo = FALSE}

inputs = MakeFPCAInputs(IDs = birds$species, tVec = birds$x, yVec = birds$dens)


fpca_obj = FPCA(Lt = inputs$Lt, Ly = inputs$Ly)
#CreateCovPlot(fpca_obj, 'Fitted',
#              isInteractive = TRUE)
```


```{r  out.width = "75%", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("./cov1.png") 
#include_graphics("./cov2.png") 
```


Using the functional analogue of spectral decomposition we can obtain the eigenfunctions of this surface and their corresponding scores for each individual species. The results are displayed below, using a 2-dimensional truncation which captures 90\% of the original variation. The first eigenfunction represents a contrast between late spring and early winter: species with high FPC1 scores will be more common in early winter and less prevalent in spring. The second eigenfunction follows a similar shape but is shifted in time: species with high FPC2 score will be more prevalent during summer and less common during late winter. In FPC space, we can group species together much more clearly than we could using only their curve representations. For example, the Oregon and Dark-Eyed Juncos exhibit very similar patterns of seasonality: with high FPC2 scores we can understand that these birds exhibit summer seasonality. 



```{r  echo = FALSE}
eigendf = data.frame(x = fpca_obj$workGrid,
                     eigen1 = fpca_obj$phi[,1],
                     eigen2 = fpca_obj$phi[,2])

eigendf_long = eigendf %>% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("eigen"))
names(eigendf_long) = c("t", "eigenfn", "value")

scoredf = data.frame(species = birdspecies, FPC1 = fpca_obj$xiEst[,1], FPC2 = fpca_obj$xiEst[,2])

ggplot(eigendf_long , aes(x = t, y = value, color = eigenfn)) + 
  geom_line() 

ggplot(scoredf, aes(x = FPC1, y = FPC2)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  xlim(c(-0.15,0.15)) + 
  geom_text_repel(
    mapping = aes(x = FPC1, 
        y = FPC2,
        label = species),
    size = 2.5,min.segment.length=0) 
```


We recognize the species on the edge of the point clouds as the species which had the outlying curves mentioned before. They represent archetypal trends for each season. Summer is in the upper left corner, while winter is in the lower left. We approximate each season with a colored quadrant: green corresponds to spring, yellow to summer, orange to fall, and purple to winter. Here we really see the underlying geometry in action: the flow of time corresponds to a clockwise rotation through FPC space. Starting at the bottom with the Ferruginous hawk and sweeping a radius clockwisely, we pass through all of the seasons before returning back to winter. Another striking observation is that the point cloud forms a ring, mimicking the circular interpretation of seasonality. This suggests that the birds in our sample are highly seasonal with only a few showing constant levels of prevalence throughout the year. We can also consider representing the original set of seasonality curves on the surface of a cylinder, instead of a flat plane, in order to mirror this latent geometry and avoid the artificial split created by the calendar year.

## Future Directions

While I originally started this project with the goal of comparing iNaturalist and eBird data, I encountered difficulty in accessing eBird's API through `spocc`. A worthwhile follow up would be to replicate this analysis using eBird data to see whether the circular geometry in FPC space remains intact. Other functionally-minded directions for the analysis of seasonality curves may map the densities into unconstrained L$^2$ space with the log-quantile density transformation before performing FPCA, or consider a time-warping based approach where the warping functions may be used to cluster seasonalities.


## Appendix

### Functional PCA
We consider a generic seasonality curve $f(t), ~t\in\mathcal{T}=[1,52]$ with mean curve $\mu(t) = E(f(t))$ and covariance surface $G(s,t)=\text{Cov}(f(s),f(t))$, which has eigenfunctions $\varphi_1(t),\varphi_2(t),\dots$. The Karhunen--Lo\`eve representation theorem states that
\begin{equation}
f(t) = \mu(t)+\sum_{k=1}^\infty \xi_k \varphi_k(t), \label{eq:KL}
\end{equation}
where the scores $\xi_k = \int_\mathcal{T} (f(t) - \mu(t)) \varphi_k(t) dt$ satisfy $E(\xi_k) = 0$, $\text{Var}( \xi_k) = \lambda_k$ and $E(\xi_k \xi_l) = 0$ for $k \neq l$. Here $\xi_k$ is the functional principal component score (FPC) of $X(\cdot)$ associated with the $k^{\text{th}}$ eigenfunction $\varphi_k$. We can view FPC scores as projections of the stochastic process onto the directions described by the eigenfunctions.

By truncating the vector representation to a finite number of $K$ components one reduces the infinite dimensionality of the curve and can approximate the original stochastic process through its most important modes of variations. That is, FPCA provides a fit of the original curve
\begin{equation}
\hat{f}(t) = \hat{\mu}(t)+\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{\xi}_k \hat{\varphi}_k(t)
\end{equation}
